# A not so short introduction to ConTeXt

It can sometimes be useful to **help someone get started** with the 
**wonderful and fascinating typesetting and document composition system** that is [**ConTeXt**](https://wiki.contextgarden.net).

**There is not much literature to help you get into it, hence my initiative.**

The problem is that I've only been using ConTeXt for a short time and still 
have many doubts, so it's possible that the introduction may contain 
errors. 

Initially written in Spanish, this document interested several people, and in 
order to increase the potential audience, a member of the [ntg-context mailing list]( https://mailman.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-context/)
(native English speaker, who wishes to remain anonymous) has proceeded to translate my text into English.

It is not a totally free licence since it does not allow it to be

restriction, I believe that the licence continues to reflect quite
well the spirit of the FDL licence, in considerably less space.

## Evolutions

The original idea of this repository was to provide a platform that would allow 
different collaborators to translate the text into different languages. 
Whether or not git is the best solution for that purpose, I really don't 
know. **What I would appreciate is a guide on "how to set up a documentation 
translation project with git?" or any other solution which may more appropriate**.

### Principles

I would appreciate, of course, any suggestions for improvement.

The document is free
and anyone who wants to include it in any ConTeXt distribution can, of course, do so. 
Also, if anyone wants the source files, I have no problem providing them: that's why this git repository was set up.

I have not based my introduction on LMTX
because I think that for beginners a more stable system, like LuaTeX, is preferable.

I could eventually clarify any doubt that the various translators 
had about the meaning of the original. It should also be taken into 
account that in the original there are some fragments or examples 
designed for a Spanish cultural field that, outside it, do not make much 
sense. In this regard, the English translation has the merit of adapting 
these fragments (instead of translating them) or deleting them, as the 
case may be.

What I don't think is to coordinate the repository: I have never worked 
on collective projects and I hardly know how github works.

Having a repository can be useful to keep a version that is always up to 
date; but that, on the other hand, would force me to be continually 
modifying the text, which in principle is not my intention. I do not 
exclude that there will be other versions in the future, but for the 
moment this is not part of my plans. 

### Ideas for future content

And if there were other versions, 
it would be more to add some chapter; mainly I think that
**the most important material that is missing is the one related to XML, Lua and Metapost**, 
that is: the three additional languages in which a ConTeXt document can be written. 

But I am far from being able to write anything 
about any of those three aspects. Some member of the [ntg-context mailing list]( https://mailman.ntg.nl/pipermail/ntg-context/) has offered to 
help me with it, but not immediately (we all have a lot of work).
